**Senior Galactic Admiral Chief Architect of Distributed Monolith-Free Quantum Microservices**  
10 light years of experience.

I code. It works. It breaks. I fix.  

Currently learning Go.  
Still want to keep learning TypeScript.  
Also plenty of other things Iâ€™ll probably never use in production.

Besides that, I like spice melange and messing with protomolecules.
